# Tomas Bangerter - Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website.
It is a React TypeScript project bootstraped with Nextjs, and it uses some of Nextjs really cool features like API Routes, CSS Modules with SASS and Webpack 5.
The contact form is managed using nodemailer and API Routes.
There are no other dependencies, the idea as of now is to keep it lightweight.

## To run locally

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

_Note_: Contact form will not work locally unless EMAIL and EMAIL_PW env variables are set, which of course I haven't uploaded to the repo.

## Live Demo

The website is deployed and hosted in Vercel:

_This is still a work in progress! Expect some unfinished functionality and placeholder text while I complete it!_

### Remaining work

- Making it SEO Friendly by completing the Heads.
- Finishing the Projects section.
- Adding another call to action to check my resume at the bottom of the home page.
- Simplify text.
- Creating a logo (maybe).
